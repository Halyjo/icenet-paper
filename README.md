# IceNet: Seasonal Arctic sea ice forecasting with probabilistic deep learing

This codebase accompanies the Nature Communications paper [Seasonal Arctic sea
ice forecasting with probabilistic deep
learning](https://doi.org/10.31223/X5430P). (TODO: update with paper link when
published.) It includes code to fully reproduce all the results of the study
from scratch. It also includes code to download the data generated by the study,
[published on the Polar Data
Centre](https://doi.org/10.5285/71820e7d-c628-4e32-969f-464b7efb187c), and
reproduce all the paper's figures.

The codebase allows you to train an ensemble of `M` U-Net neural networks for
forecasting maps of monthly-averaged Arctic sea ice concentration `1, 2, ..., N`
months into the future. A flexible data processing pipeline allows you to
dictate which variables are input to the networks, which climate simulations are
used for pre-training, and how far ahead to forecast. The architecture of the
IceNet model can be adapted in `icenet/models.py`.

The guidelines for reproducing the paper results below assume you're working in
the commandline of a Unix-like machine with a GPU. If aiming to reproduce the
results of the study, 1 TB of space should safely cover the memory requirements
from the data downloaded/generated. This space requirement is lower if not using
CMIP6 climate simulation data for pre-training (around 250 GB).

### 0) Preliminary setup

These instructions assume you have conda installed. If you don't yet
have conda, you can download it
[here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html).

To be able to download ERA5 data, you must first set up a CDS
account and populate your `.cdsapirc` file. Follow the 'Install the CDS API key'
instructions available
[here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to#install-the-cds-api-key).

To be able to download the ECMWF SEAS5 forecast data for comparing with IceNet,
you must first register with ECMWF [here](https://apps.ecmwf.int/registration/).
If you are from an ECMWF Member State, you will then have to [contact your
Computing
Representative](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/contact-us/computing-representatives)
to upgrade your account to gain access to the data. Once registered, obtain your
API key [here](https://api.ecmwf.int/v1/key/) and fill the ECMWF API entries in
`icenet/config.py`.

To track IceNet training runs and perform Bayesian hyperparameter tuning with Weights
and Biases, sign up at https://wandb.ai/site. Obtain your API key from
[here](https://wandb.ai/authorize) and fill the `wandb` entries in `icenet/config.py`.
Ensure you are logged in by running `wandb login` after setting up the conda
environment.

### 1) Set up conda environment

After cloning the repo, run the commands below in the root of the repository to
set up the conda environment:

- If you don't have [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) already, install
it to your base env for faster conda operations: `conda install -n base mamba -c
conda-forge`.
- For upgradeability use the versioned direct dependency
environment file: `mamba env create --file environment.yml`
- For reproducibility use the locked environment file: `mamba env create --file
environment.locked.yml`
- `mamba activate icenet`

### 2) Download data

- `python3 icenet/gen_masks.py`. This obtains masks for land, the polar holes,
monthly maximum ice extent, and an Arctic region & coastline mask.

- `python3 icenet/download_sic_data.py`. Downloads OSI-SAF SIC data. This computes
monthly-averaged SIC server-side, downloads the results, linearly interpolates
missing days, and bilinearly interpolates missing grid cells (e.g. polar hole).
Takes about an hour.

- `./download_era5_data_in_parallel.sh`. Downloads ERA5 reanalysis data.
This runs multiple `python3 icenet/download_era5_data.py`
commands to acquire each ERA5 variable in parallel. This downloads the raw
 ERA5 data in global latitude-longitude format and regrids to the EASE grid that
 OSI-SAF SIC data lies on.

- `./download_cmip6_data_in_parallel.sh`. Downloads CMIP6 climate simulation data.
This runs multiple `python3 icenet/download_cmip6_data.py`
commands to acquire each climate simulation. This downloads the raw
 CMIP6 data in global latitude-longitude format and regrids to the EASE grid that
 OSI-SAF SIC data lies on.

- `./rotate_wind_data_in_parallel.sh`. This rotates the ERA5 and CMIP6 wind vector data
onto the EASE grid in parallel using `icenet/rotate_wind_data.py`.

- `./download_seas5_forecasts_in_paralle.sh`. Downloads ECMWF SEAS5 SIC forecasts.
This runs multiple `python3 icenet/download_seas5_data.py`
commands to acquire 2002-2020 SEAS5 forecasts for multiple lead times in parallel
via the ECMWF MARS API.

- `python3 icenet/biascorrect_seas5_data.py`. Bias corrects the SEAS5 2012+ forecasts
using 2002-2011 forecasts. Also computes SEAS5 sea ice probability (SIP) fields.

### 3) Set up IceNet's data loader and preprocess the raw data

- `python3 icenet/gen_data_loader_config.py`. Sets up the data loader configuration.
This is saved as a JSON file dictating IceNet's input and output data,
train/val/test splits, etc. The config file is used to instantiate the
custom `IceNetDataLoader` class. Each config file is identified by a
dataloader ID, determined by a timestamp and a user-provided name. This,
together with an architecture ID set in the training script, provides an 'IceNet ID'
which uniquely identifies an IceNet ensemble model by its data configuration and
architecture.

- `python3 icenet/preproc_icenet_data.py`. Normalises the raw NetCDF data and saves it as
monthly NumPy files. The normalisation parameters (mean/std dev or min/max)
are saved as a JSON file so that new data can be preprocessed without
having to recompute the normalisation. A custom IceNetDataPreProcessor class

- The observational training & validation dataset for IceNet is just 23 GB,
which can fit in RAM on some systems and significantly speed up the fine-tuning
training phase compared with using the data loader. To benefit from this, run
`python3 icenet/gen_numpy_obs_train_val_datasets.py` to generate NumPy tensors
for the train/val input/output data. To further benefit from the training speed
improvements of `tf.data`, generate a TFRecords dataset from the NumPy tensors
using `python3 icenet/gen_tfrecords_obs_train_val_datasets.py`. The source of
observational data for training is controlled by bools in
`icenet/train_icenet.py`.

### 4) Develop the IceNet model

#### 4.1) OPTIONAL: Run the hyperparameter search (skip if using default values from paper)

- Set `icenet/train_icenet.py` up for hyperparameter tuning. Turn off pre-training
and temperature scaling in the user input section.
- `wandb sweep icenet/sweep.yaml`
- Then run the `wandb agent` command that is printed.
- Cancel the sweep after a sufficient picture on optimal hyperparameters is
built up on the [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai/home) page.

#### 4.2) Train IceNet2

- Train IceNet networks with `python3 icenet/train_icenet2.py`. This takes
hyperameter settings and the random seed for network weight initalisation as
commandline inputs. Run this multiple times with different settings of `--seed`
to train an ensemble. Trained networks are saved in
`trained_networks/<dataloader_ID>/<architecture_ID>/networks/`. If worked on a
shared machine and familiar with SLURM, you may want to wrap this command in a
SLURM script.

#### 4.3) Compute IceNet's ensemble-mean temperature scaling parameters

- `python3 icenet/compute_ensemble_mean_temp_scaling.py`.

### 5) Perform validation

- `python3 icenet/predict_heldout_data.py`. Uses `xarray` to save monthly predictions
over the validation and test years as (2012-2020) as NetCDFs for IceNet and the
linear trend benchmark. For IceNet, the full forecast dataset has dimensions
`(target date, y, x, lead time, seed, ice class)`, although an ensemble-mean
SIP version is also computed, which only has the first four dimensions.

- `python3 icenet/analyse_heldout_predictions.py`. Loads the forecast data and computes
forecast metrics, storing results in a global `pandas` DataFrame with
`MultiIndex` `(model, ensemble member, lead time, target date)` and columns
for each metric (binary accuracy and sea ice extent error). Optionally uses
`dask` to avoid loading the entire forecast datasets into memory, processing
chunks in parallel to significantly speed up the analysis. Results are saved
in `results/forecast_results/` with a timestamp to avoid overwriting.

- `python3 icenet/analyse_uncertainty.py`. Assesses the calibration of IceNet and
SEAS5's SIP forecasts. Also determines IceNet's ice edge region and assesses
its ice edge bounding ability. Results are saved in `results/uncertainrt_results/`.

### 6) Run the permute-and-predict method to explore IceNet's most important input variables

- `python3 icenet/permute_and_predict.py`. Results are stored in
`results/permute_and_predict_results/`.

### 7) Generate the paper figures and tables

- `python3 icenet/plot_paper_figures.py`. Outputs to `figures/paper_figures/`.

### Misc

- `icenet/utils.py` defines IceNet utility functions like the data preprocessor,
data loader, ERA5 and CMIP6 processing, learning rate decay, and video functionality.
- `icenet/models.py` defines network architectures.
- `icenet/config.py` defines globals.
- `icenet/losses.py` defines loss functions.
- `icenet/callbacks.py` defines training callbacks.
- `icenet/metrics.py` defines training metrics.
